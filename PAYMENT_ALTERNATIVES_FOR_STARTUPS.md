## 🔄 ALTERNATIVE APPROACH: Hybrid Solution

### Start Simple, Scale Later

**Phase 1 (Launch - Now):**
Use **USSD/Manual** for MVP:
- Show payment instructions
- Users pay via USSD codes
- You verify manually
- Simple but works!

**Phase 2 (After Launch - 1 month):**
- Sign up with Selcom
- Integrate API
- Automate payments
- Scale!

---

## 💡 SIMPLE USSD APPROACH (Quick Start)

If you want to launch IMMEDIATELY without waiting:

### Implementation:

```dart
// Show payment instructions
if (paymentMethod == 'mpesa') {
  instructions = '''
  Lipa kwa M-Pesa:
  1. Nenda *150*00#
  2. Chagua Lipa kwa M-Pesa
  3. Chagua Lipa Bili
  4. Business Number: 123456
  5. Reference: BOOKING-${bookingId}
  6. Amount: ${amount}
  
  Baada ya kulipa, piga picha receipt 
  na utume kwa support@pango.co.tz
  ''';
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Launch immediately
- ✅ No integration needed
- ✅ Works 100%
- ✅ Users familiar with USSD

**Cons:**
- ❌ Manual verification needed

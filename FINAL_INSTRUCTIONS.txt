                        ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

✓ KEEP TERMINAL OPEN:
  The backend server must stay running while you use the admin panel.
  Do NOT close the terminal window!

✓ IF TERMINAL CLOSES:
  Just open Command Prompt again and run:
    cd c:\pango\backend
    npm start

✓ KEEP BROWSER OPEN:
  The admin panel needs the server running in background

✓ PORT 3000:
  If port 3000 is already used, you'll see an error.
  Try restarting your computer or check if another app uses port 3000.

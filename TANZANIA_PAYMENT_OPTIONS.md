## 🚀 FASTEST PATH TO LAUNCH

### **MY RECOMMENDATION:**

Since finding a single aggregator might take time, here's what I suggest:

### **Phase 1: Launch with Manual Instructions (THIS WEEK)**

Build a simple payment instruction screen:

```
User selects M-Pesa →
App shows:
─────────────────────────
Malipo kwa M-Pesa:
1. Nenda *150*00#
2. Lipa kwa M-Pesa
3. Lipa Bili
4. Business Number: [Your number]
5. Reference: BOOKING-12345
6. Amount: TSh 128,000

Baada ya kulipa, piga picha
receipt na tumia WhatsApp:
+255 XXX XXX XXX
─────────────────────────
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Launch TODAY
- ✅ Start taking bookings
- ✅ Prove your concept
- ✅ Build customer base
- ✅ Generate revenue

**Then integrate automated gateway later**

---

### **Phase 2: Integrate Gateway (MONTH 2)**

While running with manual payments:
1. Contact DPO/IntaSend/Pesapal
2. Set up account
3. Get API credentials
4. I'll integrate for you
5. Switch to automated

---

## 📞 WHO TO CONTACT FIRST

### **DPO (Recommended for now):**
```
Website: https://www.dpogroup.com/
Email: support@directpayonline.com
       sales@directpayonline.com
